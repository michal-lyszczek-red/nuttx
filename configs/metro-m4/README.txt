  This directory contains the port of NuttX to the Adafruit Metro M4.  The
  Metro M4 uses a Arduino form factor and and pinout.  It's powered with an ATSAMD51J19:

  o Cortex M4 core running at 120 MHz
  o Hardware DSP and floating point support
  o 512 KB flash, 192 KB RAM
  o 32-bit, 3.3V logic and power
  o Dual 1 MSPS DAC (A0 and A1)
  o Dual 1 MSPS ADC (8 analog pins)
  o 6 x hardware SERCOM (I2C, SPI or UART)
  o 16 x PWM outputs
  o Stereo I2S input/output with MCK pin
  o 10-bit Parallel capture controller (for camera/video in)
  o Built in crypto engines with AES (256 bit), true RNG, Pubkey controller
  o 64 QFN
