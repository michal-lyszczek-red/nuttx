/* There are four LED status indicators located on the EVK Board.  The functions of
 * these LEDs include:
 *
 *   - Main Power Supply(D3)
 *     Green: DC 5V main supply is normal.
 *     Red:   J2 input voltage is over 5.6V.
 *     Off:   The board is not powered.
 *   - Reset RED LED(D15)
 *   - OpenSDA LED(D16)
 *   - USER LED(D18)
 *
 * Only a single LED, D18, is under software control.
