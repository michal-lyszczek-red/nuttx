 * Name: stm32_boardinitialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   All STM32 architectures must provide the following entry point.  This entry point
 *   is called early in the initialization -- after all memory has been configured
 *   and mapped but before any devices have been initialized.
 *

 * Name: board_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_INITIALIZE is selected, then an additional initialization call
 *   will be performed in the boot-up sequence to a function called
 *   board_initialize().  board_initialize() will be called immediately after
 *   up_initialize() is called and just before the initial application is started.
 *   This additional initialization phase may be used, for example, to initialize
 *   board-specific device drivers.
